# User-Defined Preferred Patterns and Preferences

## Development Environment

**IDE Preference:** JetBrains All Products License
- **Firmware (Python):** PyCharm Professional (with Remote SSH for Pi Zero development)
- **Mobile (Android):** IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio (both JetBrains-based)
- **Documentation/General:** Any JetBrains IDE

**Open Source Consideration:** Project setup should be IDE-agnostic (VS Code, vim, etc. all supported)
