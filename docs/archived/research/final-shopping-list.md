2. **BME680** ($20) - Replace DHT20 with superior multi-sensor
3. **Solar Panel Kit** ($25-35) - Biggest quality-of-life improvement
4. **I2C Multiplexer** ($5) - Future-proofs multi-sensor expansion
5. **Spare Sensors** ($20-30) - STEMMA Soil + BH1750 backups (outdoor failures happen)
6. **Logic Analyzer** ($10-15) - Invaluable for debugging sensor issues

**Total:** ~$95-130 for high-impact expansion

### üìù Notes on Future Sensors

**I2C Compatibility:**
- Most recommended sensors use I2C (shares same 2-wire bus as current sensors)
- I2C multiplexer allows duplicate addresses (e.g., multiple BH1750 sensors)

**Analog Sensors (EC/TDS, Wind):**
- Raspberry Pi Zero has NO built-in ADC
- Options: Add MCP3008 ADC chip ($4) OR use I2C ADC module (ADS1115, $10)
- Consider ESP32 for analog-heavy Phase 3 multi-node setup

**Power Budget:**
- BME680, pH sensor, UV sensor add minimal power draw (~5-10mA each)
- Thermal camera (MLX90640) draws ~20mA (still acceptable)
- Solar panel becomes critical if adding 5+ sensors

**Storage:**
- Additional sensors increase data volume (more columns per reading)
- 32GB MicroSD handles years of expanded data (current estimate: ~500KB/month)
