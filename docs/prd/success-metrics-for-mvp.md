# Success Metrics for MVP

**Technical Success:**
- [ ] Firmware samples sensors continuously for 7+ days without crashes or data loss
- [ ] Bluetooth sync transfers 30 days of data (3,000+ readings) in < 5 minutes
- [ ] Mobile app displays sensor data with < 2 second screen load time
- [ ] Battery life: 7+ days on 20,000mAh power bank
- [ ] Sensor accuracy meets NFR3 targets (moisture ±5%, light ±20%, temp ±1°C)

**User Value:**
- [ ] Plant database includes 25+ common garden plants with scientifically cited optimal ranges
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable and specific (not generic "water more")
- [ ] User can identify and resolve plant problems faster than trial-and-error (qualitative feedback)

**Learning Goals:**
- [ ] Developer gains hands-on experience with I2C/1-Wire sensors, Python GPIO programming
- [ ] Developer completes first end-to-end IoT project (hardware + firmware + mobile app)
- [ ] Developer builds confidence for future IoT projects (ESP32, LoRa, solar power, etc.)

**Project Completion:**
- [ ] All 4 epics delivered (33 stories completed)
- [ ] MVP deployed in real garden environment, monitoring actual plants
- [ ] Documentation complete (README, architecture, setup guides)
- [ ] GitHub repository published as open-source
